### Program Design

I co-designed several exciting programs offered by my department (within Engineering): the [Master of Business Analytics](http://mbs.edu/programs/masterbusinessanalytics/Pages/Master-Business-Analytics.aspx) (joint with the Melbourne Business School, QS-list ranked #5 globally and #1 in the Asia-Pacific), the [Bachelor of Science major in Data Science](http://bsc.unimelb.edu.au/majors/data-science) and the [Master of Data Science](http://science-courses.unimelb.edu.au/study/degrees/master-of-data-science/overview) (both joint with Maths & Stats within Science). These programs reflect the interdisciplinary nature of machine learning and its allied areas.
