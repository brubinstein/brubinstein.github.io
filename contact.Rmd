I love to hear from prospective[^1]/enrolled students, industry or government entities seeking expert assistance, and other researchers:

`{firstname}.{lastname}@unimelb.edu.au`

Or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bipr) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrubinstein).

I'm located in Room 3313 of the [Melbourne Connect Building](https://maps.unimelb.edu.au/parkville/building/290) of the university's main Parkville campus---it's usually best to make an appointment by email before meeting in person.

[^1]: <p style="font-size:75%">**Notes for prospective students.**
While [Engineering PhD admissions/scholarship](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-engineering-and-it/fees/) processes are centralised, a nominated supervisor must approve the application. I recruit 1-2 PhD students per year on average (with v high variance), co-supervised. As such I welcome contact from both domestic/international students seeking doctoral research opportunities. But I strongly suggest first browsing my [recent papers](pubs.html). My work is frequently mathematical aspects of machine learning - suitable for backgrounds with advanced mathematics. Messages highlighting fit and including CV & transcripts are more likely to receive positive responses. I apologise if I am unable to respond, as I receive a high volume of requests. Enrolled UniMelb masters students should feel free to contact me. Finally, I am usually unable to take summer interns.</p>
